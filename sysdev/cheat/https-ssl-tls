#https is encrypted sessions of http
-->Transport Layer Security (TLS) is used to encrypt the entire session

#TLS does a handshake to ensure that the server and client can decrypt encrypted data using public keys
-->creates a master key that is then used by both client and sever sessions

***if public key is knowwn, packets can be searched for the master key

#SSL is the predecessor to TLS, and not used directly anymore, but TLS was built on the same framework
