#Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)
RC4 stream cipher w/ CRC32 for integrity check
-->Crack: 
by sniffing an ARP packet, then replaying it to get many encrypted replies with different IVs
-->Avoidance: 
Use WPA2

#Wifi Protected Access (WPA)
Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) Message Integrity Check
-->Crack: 
Uses a four way handshake, and if that handshake can be captured, then a dictionary attack ban be mounted to find the Pairwise Master Key for the Access Point and client Station
-->Avoidance: 
Use long-keys

#WPA2
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
-->crack and avoidance the same was WPA
